# plot-det-curve
This repository proposes examples of DET (Detection error tradeoff) curve plot. For the moment, only one example in file *example1.py* is 

## Install requirements
To use this code, you only need to install python and then install the requirements using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Binary classification
### What is binary classification

> Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups (predicting which group each one belongs to)
> - [wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification)

### Score system
Most of the time, to do a binary classification we ask to the system for a given input to generate a score between 0 and 1. Then, we guess at which class belong the input using a threshold. If the value is less than the threshold, the class 0, otherwise, the class is 1.

### Target and Non Target
- Targets are elements to associate with the class 1.
- Non target are elements associated to the class 2.

You may encounter the variables ```__tar__``` and ```__non__```. They respectively correspond to the score gave by the system for each target elements and the non target elements.
